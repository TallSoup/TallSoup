## Hello! I'm Andrew. ðŸ‘‹

If you're looking for a Junior Python Developer who's eager to learn and become amazing at this code thing, you can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewtclarkson/).

I'm currently nearing completion of _The App Brewery's_ **100 Days of Python**.

Along the way I've learned:


- OOP
- Pandas
- Tkinter
- Calling APIs
- Creating RESTful APIs
- Webscraping with Beautiful Soup
- Automation with Selenium
- Flask
- HTML
- CSS
- Bootstrap
- WTForms
- SQLAlchemy
- SQLite
- Encryption, Hashing, Salting
- Heroku
- Discord.py


I love crypto, and am looking forward to learning a Web3 Language and building on the Blockchain.
